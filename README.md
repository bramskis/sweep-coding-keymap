# Ferris Sweep Keymap for Coding
This is a valid QMK keymap and hex file for software development using a Ferris Sweep (https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep).

It is specifically tailored to Vim keybindings, so it is suitable for development in Vim and Nvim. It utilizes four layers that handle QWERTY, numbers & symbols, window management (with space to expand), and mouse management (with space to expand).

All layer management is handled through the thumb keys.

For more information on QMK, please see their docs (https://docs.qmk.fm/). To customize this layout, the easiest way is to upload the json file to the QMK Configurator (https://config.qmk.fm/)
