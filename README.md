# Ferris Sweep Keymap for Coding
This is a valid QMK keymap and hex file for software development using a Ferris Sweep (https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep).

It is specifically tailored to Vim keybindings, so it is suitable for development in Vim and Nvim. It utilizes four layers that handle QWERTY, numbers & symbols, window management (with space to expand), and mouse management (with space to expand).

All layer management is handled through the thumb keys.

## Layer 0
